Interpreting user needs involves thoroughly understanding the problems the users are facing and what they expect from the software. This often requires direct communication with users, stakeholders, and analyzing existing systems to identify gaps.Techniques like interviews, surveys, and observations can help gather insights into what users truly need, as opposed to what they might explicitly ask for. The goal is to translate these needs into features that solve user problems and improve their experience.

User stories are a tool that bridges the gap between user needs and technical implementation. A user story is a simple, clear, and concise description of a feature from the perspective of the end-user.For example, a user story might be: "As a end user, I want to receive flight notifications so that I can stay updated on my travel schedule." User stories help developers focus on delivering value to the user. They break down complex requirements into manageable, actionable tasks that developers can prioritize and implement within sprints.

When approaching program development, it’s essential to start with a clear understanding of the project goals and user needs. Begin by gathering requirements, creating user stories, and planning the overall architecture of the program. I approach development with an iterative mindset, breaking down the project into smaller, manageable pieces that can be developed, tested, and refined over time.

Being a good team member means actively contributing to the team’s success through open communication, collaboration, and a willingness to support others. This involves regularly participating in team meetings, providing constructive feedback, and being open to feedback from others.
